***Introduction***           

The  MEME suite provides online tools for discovering and using protein and 
DNA sequence motifs.  A motif is a pattern of nucleotides or amino acids that 
appears repeatedly in a group of related  DNA or protein sequences.  The MEME 
suite represents motifs as position-dependent scoring matrices. 

The MEME suite consists of programs which allow you to: 

* MEME      - for discovery of motifs shared by a group of sequences, 
* STREME    - for discovery expression motifs in large datasets
* MEME-ChIP - for analysis of large DNA datasets like ChIPseq output,
* GLAM2     - for discovery of gapped motifs,
* MoMo      - for finding post-translationally modified protein motifs,
* DREME     - [deprecated] for discovery of short regular expression motifs,
* CentriMo  - for central enrichment analysis of motifs,
* AME       - for general enrichment analysis of motifs,
* SpaMo     - for finding motif complexes by analysing motif spacing,
* GOMo      - for finding Gene Ontology terms linked to the motifs,
* FIMO      - for scanning sequences with motifs,
* MAST      - for scanning sequences to find groups of motifs,
* MCAST     - for scanning sequences for motif clusters,
* GLAM2scan - for scanning sequences with gapped motifs,
* Tomtom    - for comparing motifs to other motifs,
* T-Gene    - for predicting regulatory links between genomic loci and genes

and that's just the web enabled tools.
