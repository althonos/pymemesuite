      <h3>Usage:</h3>
      <code>beadstring [options] &lt;motifs&gt; &lt;database&gt;</code>
    </div>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p id="meta-meme">Beadstring builds a linear hidden Markov model (HMM) from the motifs
      and motif occurrences listed in the motif file, and uses that HMM to
      search a sequence database for a particular ordered series of motifs. A
      description of the algorithm is found in:<br></p>
      <script>print_citation("meta-meme", "Meta-MEME");</script>

      <p>By default, the order and spacing of motifs in the model is determined 
      from the "Summary of Motifs" section of the MEME input file. Beadstring
      searches the summary for the sequence that contains the maximal number of
      distinct motif occurrences. If there is a tie, then beadstring selects the
      sequence with the smallest combined <i>p</i>-value. Beadstring then
      eliminates all but the most significant occurrence of each motif and uses
      the resulting order and spacing of motif occurrences to initialize the
      HMM.  This procedure can be overridden by selecting the
      <span class="popt">--motif</span>, 
      <span class="popt">--motif-e-thresh</span>,
      <span class="popt">--motif-p-thresh</span> or 
      <span class="popt">--order</span> options.</p>
      
      <p id="mcast">The command line option <span class="popt">--p-score</span> activates
      an alternative scoring mode, called "<i>p</i>-value scoring." This scoring
      method is described in:<br></p>

    <h3>Input</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <h4>Motifs</h4>
      <p>A file of motifs from MEME (DREME does not have the

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>Beadstring will create a directory, named <code>beadstring_out</code>

      overwritten. The directory will contain:</p>

        <a href="http://zlab.bu.edu/~phaverty/SupplementalData/CisML">CisML</a>
