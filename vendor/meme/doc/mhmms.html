      <h3>Usage:</h3>

    </div>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>mhmms searches a sequence database using a
      <a href="mhmm-format.html">motif-based hidden Markov model</a>
      (HMM) of the kind produced by <a href="mhmm.html">mhmm</a>. Each
      sequence in the database is assigned an E-value, and the IDs and scores of
      sequences scoring below a given threshold are printed in sorted
      order.</p>

      <p>The E-value of a given sequence is the expected number of
      sequences which match the given model as well or better than this
      sequence that you would expect to see by chance in a random
      database of the same size as the given database. Scores are
      assigned using a local search algorithm; in other words, the
      algorithm finds the subsequence that matches a subset of model
      states with highest log-odds.</p>

      <p>The emission probabilities in the model are converted to
      log-odds scores before performing the local search. This is done by
      combining pseudocount probabilities derived from a score matrix
      (see the <span class="popt">--pam</span> and
      <span class="popt">--score-file</span> options below) with the
      emission frequencies. You can control the relative weight placed on
      the emission probabilities versus the pseudocount probabilities
      (see <span class="popt">--pseudo-weight</span> below). The adjusted
      emission probabilities are then converted to odds by dividing by
      background probabilities (see <span class="popt">--bg-file</span> below).
      Finally, they are converted to log-odds scores by taking their
      logarithm.</p>

      <p>Transition probabilities are converted to log-odds scores by
      taking their logarithms before searching. This can be overridden
      and the gap scores can be set explicitly using the
      <span class="popt">--gap-open</span> and
      <span class="popt">--gap-extend</span> switches, below. This allows you
      to specify a single affine gap cost function for all spacers in the
      model.</p>

                S = -log<sub>2</sub>(p/T)
              </div>
              where <code>S</code> is the bit score of the hit, <code>p</code>
              is the <i>p</i>-value of the log-odds score, and T is the
              <i>p</i>-value threshold. In this way, only hits more significant
              than the <i>p</i>-value threshold get positive scores. The
              <i>p</i>-value threshold, <i>T</i>, must be in the range
              <i>0 &lt; T &le; 1</i>. This mode of scoring automatically activates
              the <span class="popt">-motif-scoring</span> feature (described
              below under "Advanced Options:") so that partial motif hits are
              disallowed.
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>If <i>p</i>-value threshold is too small, there may be few
                (or no) "hits", and, consequently, few (or no) matches. This
                may cause mhmms to be unable to compute match
                <i>E</i>-values, or to report no matches. Small values of the
                <i>p</i>-value threshold may also cause the reported
                <i>E</i>-values to be inaccurate. In this case, the
                <i>E</i>-values will always be too large (conservative). The
                proper value for the <i>p</i>-value threshold can only be
                determined by experimentation since it depends on the number
                of motifs, the information content of the motifs and the
                value of maxgap.</li>
                <li>If <i>p</i>-value threshold is too large, the expected
                length of a match may be longer than most of the sequences in
                the database you are searching. This will prevent mhmmscan
                from being able to compute <i>E</i>-values. Very low values
                of <i>p</i>-value threshold, when search genomic DNA, tend to
                give high scores to low-complexity sequence and repeated
                elements.</li>
