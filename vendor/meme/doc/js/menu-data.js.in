The <i>E</i>-value and the <i>q</i>-value of each match is also reported.  The <i>q</i>-value is the minimal false discovery rate at which the observed similarity would be deemed significant.  The output contains results for each query, in the order that the queries appear in the input file.  <br><br>The web version of Tomtom provides a large number of target motif databases, or you can upload your own motifs in <a href=meme-format.html>MEME Motif Format</a>, or enter them by typing in many additional formats.  <br><br>For a given pair of motifs, the program considers all offsets between the motifs, while requiring a minimum number of overlapping positions. For a given offset, each overlapping position is scored using one of seven column similarity functions defined below. Columns in the query motif that don't overlap the target motif are assigned a score equal to the median score of the set of random matches to that column. <br><br>In order to compute the scores, Tomtom needs to know the frequencies of the letters of the sequence alphabet in the database being searched (the 'background' letter frequencies). By default, the background letter frequencies included in the query motif file are used. The scores of columns that overlap for a given offset are summed. This summed score is then converted to a <i>p</i>-value. The reported <i>p</i>-value is the minimal <i>p</i>-value over all possible offsets.  To compensate for multiple testing, each reported <i>p</i>-value is converted to an <i>E</i>-value by multiplying it by twice the number of target motifs.  As a second type of multiple-testing correction, <i>q</i>-values for each match are computed from the set of <i>p</i>-values and reported.</footer>",
