    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The name AMA stands for "Average Motif Affinity". The program scores
      a set of sequences given a binding motif, treating each position
      in the sequence as a possible binding event. The score is calculated by
      averaging the likelihood ratio scores for all feasible binding events to
      the given sequence (and to its reverse strand for complementable alphabets).
      The binding strength at
      each potential site is defined as the likelihood ratio of the site under
      the motif versus under a zero-order background model provided by the
      user.</p>
      <p>By default, AMA reports the average motif affinity score. It can also
      report <i>p</i>-values, which are estimated analytically using the given
      zero-order background model or using the GC-content of each
      sequence. The GC-content options are restricted to alphabets with 4
      symbols in 2 complementary pairs, like DNA.</p>
      <p>AMA can also compute the sequence-dependent likelihood ratio score
      used by Clover. The denominator of this score depends on the sequence
      being scored, and is the likelihood of the site under a Markov model
      derived from the sequence itself.  Unlike Clover, AMA also allows
      higher-order sequence-derived Markov models (see
      <span class="popt">--sdbg</span> option below).</p>
      <p>If the input file contains more than one motif, the motifs will be
      processed consecutively.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> AMA does not score sequence positions that contain ambiguous characters.</p>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <h4><span class='popt'>&lt;motif file&gt;</h4>
      <p>The name of a file containing motifs in <a href="meme-format.html">MEME Motif format</a>.</p>
      <h4><span class='popt'>&lt;sequence file&gt;</h4>
      <p>The name of a file containing a sequences in <a href="fasta-format.html">FASTA</a> format.</p>
      <h4><span class='popt'>[&lt;background file&gt;]</h4>
      <p>(Optional sometimes) The name of a file containing a 0-order Markov Model in
      <a href="bfile-format.html">background model format</a> such as produced
      by <a href="fasta-get-markov.html"><code>fasta-get-markov</code></a>.
      If both strands are being scored, the background model will be modified by averaging the 
      frequencies of letters and their reverse complements.
      <br><b>Note:</b> This is a required option unless <span class="popt">--sdbg</span> is
      specified.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>AMA writes in <a href="http://zlab.bu.edu/~phaverty/SupplementalData/CisML">CisML</a> 
      format to standard out, unless you specify one of
      <span class="popt">--o</span> or <span class="popt">--oc</span>. 
      In that case, the <span class="popt">--o-format</span> option (if given) is ignored
      and two output files are written to the directory you specify.
      The files are <code>ama.xml</code> in CISML format, and <code>ama.txt</code>
      in (almost) <a href="http://gmod.org/wikieGFF2">GFF2</a> format.
      </p>
      <p>AMA's version of the <a href="http://gmod.org/wiki/GFF2">GFF2</a> 
	format uses the "sequence strand" field (field 7) to hold the <i>p</i>-value of
	the sequence: 
      <pre> &lt;sequence_name&gt; ama sequence 1 &lt;sequence_length&gt; &lt;sequence_score&gt; &lt;sequence_p-value&gt; . &lt;motif_id&gt;</pre>
