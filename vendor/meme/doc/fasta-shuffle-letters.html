      <h3>Usage:</h3>
      <code>fasta-shuffle-letters [options] &lt;sequence file&gt; [&lt;output file&gt;]</code>
    </div>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The program fasta-shuffle-letters creates a shuffled version of a FASTA file.
      The letters in each sequence in the input file are shuffled in such a way
      that k-mer frequencies are exactly preserved where k is by default 1 but
      may be set by the "<span class="popt">-kmer</span>" option.  If an alphabet
      is specified via <span class="popt">-dna</span>, <span class="popt">-rna</span>,
      <span class="popt">-protein</span> or <span class="popt">-alph</span>,
      any aliased symbols are first converted to their core symbol before shuffling.
      By default, aliased symbols are <i>not</i> converted to their core symbols, and are
      treated as distinct letters, which may not be what you want.
      
      <p>The underlying implementation uses 
      <a href="http://digital.cs.usu.edu/~mjiang/ushuffle/">uShuffle</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Input</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <h4><span class='popt'>&lt;sequence file&gt;</span></h4>
      <p>The name of a file of sequences in <a href="fasta-format.html">FASTA format</a> from a file.</p>
      <h4><span class='popt'>&lt;output file&gt;</span></h4>
      <p>(Optional) The name of a file to receive the shuffled sequences.
    </div>

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>Writes a <a href="fasta-format.html">FASTA format</a> file to the
      optional output file or standard output if it is left unspecified.</p>

            more realistic the resulting sequences will be,  but setting <span class="pdat">k</span>
            too large will prevent the sequences from being shuffled at all! 
	     A value of 2 is used by MEME-ChIP. For values
            larger than 1, specifying the alphabet is highly recommended because
            it allows for the translation of aliases which may be important in
            some cases like soft-masked sequence.</td>
