      <h1>The MEME Suite</h1>
      <h2>Motif-based sequence analysis tools</h2>
    </div>
    <h2>Custom Alphabet Definition Format</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>Almost all MEME Suite programs make use of alphabets to understand the
      meaning of sequences or motifs. The MEME Suite programs support
      three standard alphabets: the <a href="alphabets.html#dna">DNA</a>,
      <a href="alphabets.html#rna">RNA</a> and
      <a href="alphabets.html#protein">protein</a> alphabets. 
      The MEME Suite also allows you to define a custom
      alphabet to allow you to explore motifs containing, for example
      modified nucleotides (e.g., methylcytosines) or modified amino acids
      (e.g., phosphorylated serines and tyrosines).</p> 
      <p>This document describes how you can specify an alphabet of your 
      own design for use with the MEME Suite programs that support custom alphabets.
      When you specify a custom alphabet, you can define the symbols
      that represent each nucleotide or amino acid, their names, their colors
      and their complements (in the case of alphabets like DNA that have complementary
      residues).  You also can also define "ambiguous" symbols that represent
      more than one symbol in your custom alphabet (e.g., "R" to represent purines
      in a DNA-based alphabet.) You then provide your
      custom alphabet definition as a text file to the MEME Suite programs
      to inform them that sequences you provide use this non-standard alphabet.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
    <p>You can look at some examples of alphabet definitions to
    get a quick idea of how they look.  The first two examples
    define the standard DNA and protein alphabets supported by
    the MEME Suite. Note that everything after the "#" character anywhere
    on the line is treated as a comment (ignored) by the MEME Suite.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#standard_DNA">Standard DNA alphabet</a></li>
      <li><a href="#standard_RNA">Standard RNA alphabet</a>
      <li><a href="#standard_protein">Standard protein alphabet</a></li>
      <li><a href="#custom_DNA">DNA with covalent modifications alphabet</a>
    </ol>

    <h3>Format Specification</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The alphabet definition contains the following sections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#spec_header">Header</a></li>
        <li><a href="#spec_core">Core Symbols</a></li>
        <li><a href="#spec_ambig">Ambiguous Symbols and Aliases</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h4 id="spec_header">Header</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>The header line signals that the file is an alphabet definition,
        gives the name of the alphabet and specifies if it is like a standard
        alphabet.</p>
        <div class="example">
          ALPHABET &quot;<span class="pdat">name</span>&quot; <span class="pdat">standard</span>-LIKE
        </div>
        
        <p>The &quot;<span class="pdat">name</span>&quot; is optional and gives
        the name that is used to refer to the alphabet in outputs. It follows
        all the rules of <a href="#qstr">quoted text</a>.
        If the name is not given, then the alphabet will be referred to
        by the list of its core symbols.</p>

        <p>The <span class="pdat">standard</span>-LIKE is also optional and can be
        used to specify a reference alphabet that this alphabet might be
        sensibly compared to under most circumstances. Adding this optional flag
        will require that the alphabet you are defining has the uppercase form of
        all the reference alphabet's core symbols as well as their complements.
        The possible values for <span class="pdat">standard</span> include DNA,
        RNA and PROTEIN.</p>
        <p>For example if you were creating an alphabet that extended the DNA
        alphabet you might use a header like:</p>
        <div class="example">
          ALPHABET &quot;Extended DNA&quot; DNA-LIKE
        </div>
        <p>This would require that the alphabet you were defining contained A,
        C, G and T and that A was the complement of T and C was the complement
        of G.</p>
      </div>


      <h4 id="spec_core">Core Symbols</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>The core <a href="#allowed_chars">symbols</a> of an alphabet can either 
        be defined on their own or two per line with a '~' between them to show 
        them as complements.</p>
        <p>For example you can define the symbol 'A' and the symbol 'T' to be
        complements of each other as follows:</p>
        <div class="example">
          A ~ T
        </div>
        <p>However if 'A' and 'T' do not have complements then you would define
        them on separate lines:</p>
        <div class="example">
        A<br>
        T
        </div>
        <p>Listing a letter like 'A' or 'T' is the simplest way to
        define a symbol but you can also specify a
        <a href="#spec_adv_sym">name and color</a> for each symbol.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="spec_ambig">Ambiguous Symbols and Aliases</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>The ambiguous symbols of an alphabet are listed after all the core
        symbols have been defined. An ambiguous symbol will have the symbol
        definition on the left, followed by an equals '=' and a list of
        core symbols on the right.</p>
        <p>For example you can defined the symbol 'N' to represent 'A', 'C', 'G'
        or 'T' as follows:</p>
        <div class="example">
          N = ACGT
        </div>
        <p>If there is a <b>single</b> core symbol on the right of
	an ambiguous symbol definition, the symbol is considered to be an <b>alias</b>
	for the core symbol on the left.
        <p>For example you can defined the symbol 'U' to be an alias for 'T'
        as follows:</p>
        <div class="example">
          U = T		# (U is an alias for T)
        </div>
        <p>As with the core symbols you can also specify a
        <a href="#spec_adv_sym">name and color</a> for each ambiguous and alias symbol.</p>
        <p>How ambiguous symbols and aliases are handled differs for each
        of the programs in the MEME Suite.  See the specific documentation
        for each program for how they treat ambiguous symbols.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <h3 id="additional">Additional Information</h3>
    <div class="indent">

      <h4 id="allowed_chars">Allowed Symbol Characters</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>Each <span class="pdat">symbol</span> is a single <b>letter</b>, <b>number</b> or
        one of the <b>four special characters</b> '.', '-', '*' or '?'. 
        Letters may be either
        uppercase or lowercase (see <a href="#one_case">Letter Case</a>
        below on the interpretation of case by MEME Suite programs).
        The '?' is a special <a href="#spec_wildcard">wildcard</a> character,
        and if you use it you must define it to match all core symbols
        (see <a href="#spec_wildcard">Wildcard Symbol</a>, below).</p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="one_case">Letter Case</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>If all the letters you define as symbols are in a single case, 
        (all uppercase or all lowercase), the programs in the MEME Suite will 
        ignore case when reading sequences.
        However, if you include both uppercase and lowercase letters in your
        alphabet definition, then uppercase and lowercase letters will
        be treated as distinct symbols.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="ordering">Core Symbol Ordering</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>MEME Suite programs internally order core symbols
        so that the uppercase letters A-Z come first, followed by the 
        lowercase letters a-z, then by the numbers 0-9 and finally by 
        the symbols '*', '-' and '.' in that order.  
        (Note that '?' is not included in this list because it is never
        allowed to be a core symbol.)
        This ordering is used to determine the order of the columns in 
        motifs output by MEME Suite motif discovery programs.
        Note: The order in which you specify symbols within the
        core symbol section of your alphabet file does not matter.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="spec_wildcard">Wildcard Symbol</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>A wildcard is an ambiguous symbol that matches any core symbol.
        To define a wildcard symbol, list all the core symbols after the equals sign. 
        Since many programs in the MEME Suite require that alphabets have a 
        wildcard symbol in order for them to work correctly, if you do not
        define one the MEME Suite program will automatically define
        the symbol '?' to be the wildcard.
        It is strongly recommended that all custom alphabets you define
        include a wildcard symbol.</p>
        <p>If you wish, you may manually define the wildcard as '?'.</p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="spec_adv_sym">Advanced Symbol Definition</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>Each symbol definition can have up to three fields as follows:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <span class="pdat">character</span> &quot;<span class="pdat">name</span>&quot; <span class="pdat">color</span>
        </div>
        <h5>character</h5>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>The symbol &quot;<span class="pdat">character</span>&quot; is a single
          character chosen from the list of <a href="#allowed_chars">allowed symbol characters</a>.
          The symbol character is required and is always the first field.
        </div>
        <h5>name</h5>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>The symbol &quot;<span class="pdat">name</span>&quot; is optional but it will
          make any outputs generated using this alphabet easier to understand by
          providing a reference on the meaning of the symbols used. If present, the
          symbol name must be the second field.</p>
          <p>The &quot;<span class="pdat">name</span>&quot; follows the rules of
          <a href="#qstr">quoted text</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>color</h5>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>The symbol <span class="pdat">color</span> is optional and
          represented by a 6 digit hexadecimal number with
          digits 1 &amp; 2 defining the red component, digits 3 &amp; 4 defining the
          green component and digits 5 &amp; 6 defining the blue component.</p>
          <p>Here are some example colors: 
          <span style="color:#CC0000;">CC0000</span>, 
          <span style="color:#008000;">008000</span>, 
          <span style="color:#0000CC;">0000CC</span>, 
          <span style="color:#FFB300;">FFB300</span>,
          <span style="color:#FF00FF;">FF00FF</span>,
          <span style="color:#FFCCCC;">FFCCCC</span>,
          <span style="color:#FFFF00;">FFFF00</span> and
          <span style="color:#33E6CC;">33E6CC</span>.
          </p>
          <p><b>Find the numerical codes for colors by clicking here:</b>
          <input type="color" id="colour_picker" value="#000000"> = <span id="colour_value">000000</span>.</p>
          <script>
          (function() {
           var input = document.getElementById("colour_picker");
           var output = document.getElementById("colour_value");
           var update = function() {
             output.textContent = input.value.substring(1).toUpperCase();
             output.style.color = input.value;
           };
           update();
           input.addEventListener((input.type == "color" ? "input" : "change"), update, false);
           })();
          </script>
          <p>If you do not specify the color of one or more symbols, the MEME Suite
          will choose evenly spaced colors for them using its own algorithm.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4 id="qstr">Quoted Text</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>Quoted text is used to describe things like the name
        of a symbol or the name of the alphabet and will be displayed in outputs. 
        They make the alphabet definition self documenting, and while they aren't,
        required they are highly recommended.</p>
        <p>There are a few restrictions on quoted text:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Must begin and end with a double-quote character which designates the
          bounds and is not considered part of the text</li>
          <li>Must not contain control characters</li>
          <li>Must not contain whitespace (ie tab, newline, ...) other than the
          standard 'SPACE' (U+0020)</li>
          <li>Contained double-quote characters must be escaped as \&quot;</li>
          <li>Contained back-slash characters must be escaped as \\</li>
          <li>Contained forward-slash characters may be optionally escaped as \/</li>
          <li>Contained Unicode characters may be optionally escaped \u<span class="pdat">4
            hexadecimal digits</span> although UTF-8 encoding is also fine</li>
          <li>No other back-slash escape combinations are allowed although \b \f
          \n \r and \t will be understood by the parser for the purpose of giving
          a better error message.</li>
          <li>Maximum length of 40 unicode characters (not bytes) after removing 
          the surrounding double-quotes and converting all escape sequences</li>
          <li>The comment character # will be ignored within quoted text</li>
        </ul>
