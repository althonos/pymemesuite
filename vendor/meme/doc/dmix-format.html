    <h2>MEME Dirichlet Mixtures Format</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>A Dirichlet mixture file specifies residues' tendencies to align
      with one another, and is the basis for scoring columns of aligned
      residues in MEME and GLAM2.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Format Specification</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The format is identical to that of the 
      <a href="https://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/dirichlets/">UCSC
      Dirichlet mixtures</a>.  The default 30-component mixture prior
	used by MEME is given <a href="examples/prior30.plib">here</a>.</p>  
    </div>

    <h2>GLAM2 Dirichlet Mixtures Format</h2>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>The GLAM2 programs use the same format as MEME but
      only read lines beginning with Mixture= or
      Alpha=. Mixture= is followed by a number giving the weight of that
      mixture component: these weights should sum to 1. Alpha= is followed by
      a list of numbers giving the pseudocounts for that mixture component, as
      many as there are symbols in the alphabet. The first number after Alpha=
      is the sum of the pseudocounts, and is in fact ignored by the GLAM2
      programs.</p>

      <p>The pseudocounts should be in the same order as the alphabet
      symbols. For the n (nucleotide) alphabet, this is: acgt. For the p
      (protein) alphabet, this is: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY.</p>

      <p>If no Dirichlet mixture file is specified, the GLAM2 programs
      use recode3.20comp for the p (protein) alphabet, glam_tfbs.1comp for the n
      (nucleotide) alphabet, and a uniform prior for user-specified alphabets.</p>
