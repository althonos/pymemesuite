## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

The MEME suite is a collection of tools used for discovery and analysis of
biological sequence motifs.

`pymemesuite` is a Python module, implemented using the [Cython](https://cython.org)
language, that provides bindings to the MEME suite. It directly interacts with the
MEME internals, which has the following advantages over CLI wrappers:

- **single dependency**: If your software or your analysis pipeline is
  distributed as a Python package, you can add `pymemesuite` as a dependency
  to your project, and stop worrying about the MEME binaries being properly
  setup on the end-user machine.
- **no intermediate files**: Everything happens in memory, in Python objects
  you have control on, making it easier to pass your inputs to MEME without
  needing to write them to a temporary file. Output retrieval is also done
  in memory.

*This library is still a work-in-progress, and in an experimental stage,
but it should already pack enough features to run biological analyses or
workflows involving `fimo`.*


<!-- ## üîß Installing

`pymemesuite` can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymemesuite/),
which hosts some pre-built CPython wheels for x86-64 Linux, as well as the
code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pymemesuite
```

A [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) package is also available:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pymemesuite
``` -->

<!-- ## üìñ Documentation

A complete [API reference](https://pymemesuite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/) can
be found in the [online documentation](https://pymemesuite.readthedocs.io/), or
directly from the command line using
[`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html):
```console
$ pydoc pymemesuite
``` -->
